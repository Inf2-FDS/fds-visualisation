  abstract     = {{The web provides an unprecedented opportunity to
                  evaluate ideas quickly using controlled experiments,
                  also called randomized experiments (single-factor or
                  factorial designs), A/B tests (and their
                  generalizations), split tests, Control/Treatment
                  tests, and parallel flights. Controlled experiments
                  embody the best scientific design for establishing a
                  causal relationship between changes and their
                  influence on user-observable behavior. We provide a
                  practical guide to conducting online experiments,
                  where end-users can help guide the development of
                  features. Our experience indicates that significant
                  learning and return-on-investment (ROI) are seen
                  when development teams listen to their customers,
                  not to the Highest Paid Person's Opinion (HiPPO). We
                  provide several examples of controlled experiments
                  with surprising results. We review the important
                  ingredients of running controlled experiments, and
                  discuss their limitations (both technical and
                  organizational). We focus on several areas that are
                  critical to experimentation, including statistical
                  power, sample size, and techniques for variance
                  reduction. We describe common architectures for
                  experimentation systems and analyze their advantages
                  and disadvantages. We evaluate randomization and
                  hashing techniques, which we show are not as simple
                  in practice as is often assumed. Controlled
                  experiments typically generate large amounts of
                  data, which can be analyzed using data mining
                  techniques to gain deeper understanding of the
                  factors influencing the outcome of interest, leading
                  to new hypotheses and creating a virtuous cycle of
                  improvements. Organizations that embrace controlled
                  experiments with clear evaluation criteria can
                  evolve their systems with automated optimizations
                  and real-time analyses. Based on our extensive
                  practical experience with multiple systems and
                  organizations, we share key lessons that will help
                  practitioners in running trustworthy controlled
                  experiments.}},

  abstract     = {Author summary Computers are now essential in all
                  branches of science, but most researchers are never
                  taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for
                  research computing. As a result, data can get lost,
                  analyses can take much longer than necessary, and
                  researchers are limited in how effectively they can
                  work with software and data. Computing workflows
                  need to follow the same practices as lab projects
                  and notebooks, with organized data, documented
                  steps, and the project structured for
                  reproducibility, but researchers new to computing
                  often don't know where to start. This paper presents
                  a set of good computing practices that every
                  researcher can adopt, regardless of their current
                  level of computational skill. These practices, which
                  encompass data management, programming,
                  collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects,
                  tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn
                  from a wide variety of published sources from our
                  daily lives and from our work with volunteer
                  organizations that have delivered workshops to over
                  11,000 people since 2010.},
